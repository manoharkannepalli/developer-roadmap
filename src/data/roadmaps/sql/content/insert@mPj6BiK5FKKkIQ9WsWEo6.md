# Insert
The INSERT statement in SQL is used to add new records to a table. You can specify the columns in which you want to insert data or insert data into all columns if you have values for all of them. Hereâ€™s the basic syntax of an INSERT statement:

sql

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name) 
VALUES (101, 'John', 'Doe');

In this example, a new record is added to the employees table with specific values for the employee_id, first_name, and last_name columns.
