# Delete

The DELETE statement in SQL is used to remove records from a table based on a specified condition. If no condition is specified, all records in the table will be deleted (be careful with this!). Hereâ€™s the basic syntax of a DELETE statement:

SQL Code Example

DELETE FROM employees 
WHERE employee_id = 101;

In this example, the record with employee_id equal to 101 is deleted from the employees table.
